This work has been deaccessioned from the Museum’s collection because finer examples exist in the Museum’s collection and it is unlikely that this work will be exhibited in the future.  

In accordance with the Museum’s policy, due to the value of the work (est. $100,000) and the fact that it has been on exhibition in the Museum in the preceding ten years, public notice is being given that the Museum plans to dispose of the work via public auction.  If you have comments on the Museum’s plan to dispose of the work, please send them to deaccessioning@metmuseu"
